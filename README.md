# Mausam-Predictor
Welcome to "Mausam Predictor", a comprehensive web application crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an external weather API. This platform empowers you to explore accurate weather predictions for the next 10 days, helping you plan ahead and stay prepared for changing weather conditions.
I have used the OpenWeatherMap API for this project.
